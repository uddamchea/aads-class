## Goals

- Compression
- Decompression

## Compression

### Build a tree. Node

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, letter, weight, left=None, right=None):
        self.letter = letter
        self.weight = weight
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.weight < other.weight

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Node({self.letter}, {self.weight}, {self.left}, {self.right})"
```

### Build a tree. Algorithm

- Calculate weight (frequency) of each letter in text
- Turn each letter into a `Node` and add them to a `heap`
  - Lowest frequency (probability) will have the highest priority
- While possible continue the following:
  - pop two nodes from the heap
  - combine them into a new node with the new `weight` as a sum of their `weight`s
  - add new node to the heap
- Stop the process when there is only one node left in the heap
  - This is the `root` of the tree

### Example

```text
A_DEAD_DAD_CEDED_A_BAD_BABE_A_BEADED_ABACA_BED
```

```python
{'A': 11, '_': 10, 'D': 10, 'E': 7, 'B': 6, 'C': 2}
```

### Making codes

- Assign a code (sequence of 0 and 1) to every letter in the tree
- The more frequent is the letter, the shorter is the code

### Making codes. Algorithm

- Start with the `root` of the tree, empty `path`, and an empty dictionary
- If `root` is `None`, stop
- If `root.letter` is not `None`, add it to the dictionary
  - set the value of the letter to the `path`
- Continue recursively
  - mark nodes in the left subtree by adding _0_ to the `path`
  - mark nodes in the right subtree by adding _1_ to the `path`

## Decompression

- Read a stream of bits
- Traverse the tree until `node.letter` is not `None`
- Continue

## Summary
