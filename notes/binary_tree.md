## Goals

- Binary tree ADT
- Binary tree implementation

## ADT

### Definition 1

Set of nodes and a set of edges.

1. One node is the _root_
1. Every node _n_, except the _root_, is connected to exactly one parent
1. A unique path exists between the root and each node

### Definition 2

A tree is either empty or consists of a _root_ and zero or more subtrees, each of which is also a tree.

### Traversal

## Implementation

### Traversing a tree

- Pre-order
- In-order
- Post-order
- By layers
- Recursive vs iterative

## Summary

- Binary tree ADT
- Binary tree implementation
